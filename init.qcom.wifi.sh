# This script will load and unload the wifi driver to put the wifi in
# in deep sleep mode so that there won't be voltage leakage.
# Loading/Unloading the driver only incase if the Wifi GUI is not going
# to Turn ON the Wifi. In the Script if the wlan driver status is
# ok(GUI loaded the driver) or loading(GUI is loading the driver) then
# the script won't do anything. Otherwise (GUI is not going to Turn On
# the Wifi) the script will load/unload the driver
# This script will get called after post bootup.
